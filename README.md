## 🌼 Description

A Regular Expression, or a "Regex", is a string of characters that is used to define the pattern of the subject that is being searched.  The string of characters is made up of upper and lower case letters, digits/numbers, whitespace, and special characters.  The subject that is being searched could be as simple as one word, or more complex like an email address.
